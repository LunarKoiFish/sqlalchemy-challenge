# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, we are tasked with the challenge of doing some trip planning to Hawaii. We need to do climate analysis for the area. 

In Part 1, we analyze and explore climate data by doing an analysis on precipitation and stations. To do this we use python and SQLAlchemy ORM quries as well as Pandas and matplotlib. We learned that USC00519281 is the station with the greatest number of observations.

In Part 2, we design a climate app based on our initial analysis. This app uses Flask API to create routes to different pages. Using the app we can obtain precipitation, statoin or tobs data. We also use dynamic routes to set custom dates for our range of data.

This code was based on challenges and activities within this UCI bootcamp. Xpert Learning assistant and ChatGPT was used to help refined the code and gave pointers on what can be improved. 


Please note that Step 6 of Precipitation is incomplete. I am unable to replicate the plot shown in the example. There were difficulties in styling/formatting it correctly. The current plot is the closest of what I can get to the example.
